## The Challenge
Social media dependency has skyrocketed since COVID-19, fundamentally changing the communication, news consumption, and how we interact with the world. Lockdowns and social isolation accelerated this reliance, cementing social media as a vital tool for staying informed, entertained, and maintaining relationships. We need healthy and sustainable strategies to manage our digital lives.

## The Problem
Many users fall prey to social media algorithms, wasting 30+ minutes per app through aimless scrolling. With platforms like Instagram, Twitter/X, Reddit, YouTube, and TikTok vying for attention, average screen time easily exceeds 5 hours daily—even higher for younger generations. Existing tools are very limited and often fall short, either being overly restrictive or too lenient to counteract addictive design elements.
